# TVMaze-Angular!

This repo contains a re-do of the [TVMaze-React exercise](https://github.com/CKKOK/tvmaze-react), a simple front-end search interface for the TVMaze API as a Single Page Application with infinite scroll on results from an empty query. The exercise was originally done using React. The creation of this exercise was used as a revision of the Angular framework.

At this scale, it is likely that React offers a quicker time to live, and a better dev experience.
